Beyond research, I’m growing as a developer with passions for front-end web development and AI-powered technologies. I enjoy coding, designing beautiful interfaces, and solving algorithm problems. Recently, I am interested in building applications powered by Large Language Models to facilitate productivity.

### Interests

I love 🏔️ hiking and ✈️ traveling. During 2022-2024, I have climbed 16 mountains across Japan. In 2024, I had the chance to visit the 🇺🇸 US and 🇮🇹 Italy.

I also like ☕️ coffee (latte!) and 🍰 desserts.
