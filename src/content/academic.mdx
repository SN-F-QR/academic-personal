## Academic

Hi! I am a master's student (M2) in Computer Science at Waseda University, advised by [Prof. Tatsuo Nakajima](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=hVxdgeYAAAAJ&hl=ja).

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from the Electronic Information School at Wuhan University, China, where I was supervised by Prof. Guangyi Yang. I was a research intern at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the guidance of Assistant Prof. Lik-Hang Lee and Prof. Pan Hui.

My research interests focus on eXtended Reality (XR), User Interface (UI), and Human-Centered Design.

- I am interested in HCI / VR / AI / LLM.
- I am introducing LLM to XR spaces, improving the interaction efficiency!
